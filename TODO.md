- ~~Allow Enemies to shoot - DONE~~
- Smarter Enemy movement and attack

The enemy shooting pattern is cool. 4 quick shots and then a longer cooldown. More intelligent movement might be interesting
, especially for a boss battle. And some more different attack types - like multiple bullets sprayed out - a large laser type attack, etc

- Levels and Progression

Concepts of levels and progression is a critical component of every game. Even within a battle, getting a special attack once we defeat a number of small enemies would be cool.
